Primarily known as an award-winning music video director, Jay Hollinsworth received his formal training at the Hartford Art School in Connecticut. After graduating with a degree in film/video, Hollinsworth spent the early nineties in Chicago working on screenplays and honing his craft at several local co-operatives, including Chicago Filmmakers and the Center for New Television. He returned to New England and quickly landed production design jobs on two Michael Mongillo projects, The Wind (2001) and A Love Letter to Steve McQueen (2002). He and Mongillo also shared a writing collaboration on the short Circuit (1995) and Hollinsworth's first feature Broken (2005).  --IMDb profile
